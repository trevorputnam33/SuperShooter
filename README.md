# SuperShooter
Hands-on Unity Game Development Walkthrough

Developed by Trevor Putnam
Started on November 2020

SuperShooter is not created with the intent to make money, but rather with the intent to teach myself C# and further my understanding of OOP.
I will be programming SuperShooter as I read along each chapter of "Hands-On Unity 2020 Game Development" by Nicolas Alejandro Borromeo. (HOU20GD)
